We show that polynomials admit multiples supported on prime exponents.

> **Proposition 1.**
Let \\(f\\) be a polynomial over a field \\(k\\). Then there is a polynomial \\(g\\) divisible by \\(f\\) which is a linear combination of the polynomials
\\[\\{x^p:p\text{ is prime}\\}.\\]

*Proof.*
Observe that
\\[\frac{k[x]}{(f(x))}\\]
is a finite-dimensional vector space. Thus, some nonzero linear combination of the polynomials in
\\[\\{x^p:p\text{ is prime}\\}.\\]
is required to vanish in the quotient \\(k[x]/(f(x))\\). The result follows. \\(\blacksquare\\)

> **Remark 2.**
Of course, there is noting special about primes, as the proof makes clear.
