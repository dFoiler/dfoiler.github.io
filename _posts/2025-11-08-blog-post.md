We work out some basic facts about quadratic Dirichlet characters from the perspective of Galois theory.

Recall that the Kronecker–Weber theorem shows that
\\[\mathbb Q^{\mathrm{ab}}=\bigcup\_{N\ge1}\mathbb Q(\zeta_N).\\]
Thus, there is a canonical isomorphism
\\[\widehat{\mathbb Z}^\times\to\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb Q^{\mathrm{ab}}/\mathbb Q)=\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q)^{\mathrm{ab}}.\\]
In the sequel, we will denote this isomorphism by \\(\operatorname{Art}_{\mathbb Q}\\). This allows us to make the following definition.

> **Definition 1.**
Fix a quadratic extension \\(K\\) of \\(\mathbb Q\\). Then we define the *quadratic character \\(\chi_K\\)* of \\(K\\) to be the composite
\\[\widehat{\mathbb Z}^\times\cong\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q)^{\mathrm{ab}}\twoheadrightarrow\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb Q)\cong\\{\pm1\\}\subseteq\mathbb C^\times.\\]
If \\(K=\mathbb Q(\sqrt d)\\), we may abbreviate \\(\chi_K\\) to \\(\chi_d\\).

> **Remark 2.**
It is a bit dishonest to use the Kronecker–Weber theorem to define these characters. Technically, one only needs to know that the quadratic field \\(K\\) is contained in a cyclotomic field, which can be shown directly. Alternatively, one can simply view the quadratic character \\(\chi_K\\) as defined on \\(\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb Q^{\mathrm{ab}}/\mathbb Q)\\).

We are interested in proving some basic facts on these characters. Here is the kind of calculation we want to do.

> **Example 3.**
Fix a quadratic extension \\(K\\) of \\(\mathbb Q\\). Then we claim that
\\[\chi_K(-1)\stackrel?=\begin{cases}+1 & \text{if }K\text{ is real}, \\\\ -1 & \text{if }K\text{ is imaginary}.\end{cases}\\]
To start, note \\(-1\in\widehat{\mathbb Z}^\times\\) goes to the automorphism \\(\operatorname{Art}\_{\mathbb Q}(-1)\\) which sends \\(\zeta\\) to \\(\zeta^{-1}\\) for each root of unity \\(\zeta\\). But \\(\overline\zeta=\zeta^{-1}\\), so we see that \\(\operatorname{Art}\_{\mathbb Q}(-1)\\) is complex conjugation. It follows that \\(\chi_K(-1)=+1\\) if and only if complex conjugation acts trivially on \\(K\\), so the result follows.

If we squint, we can make the above example also work for "finite places."

> **Example 4.**
Fix a quadratic extension \\(K\\) of \\(\mathbb Q\\), and let \\(p\\) be a rational prime unramified in \\(K\\). Then we claim
\\[\chi_K(p)\stackrel?=\begin{cases}+1 & \text{if }K\subseteq\mathbb Q_p, \\\\ -1 & \text{if }K\not\subseteq\mathbb Q_p.\end{cases}\\]
Indeed, note that \\(\operatorname{Art}_{\mathbb Q}(p)\\) is acting by the \\(p\\)th power on a generating set of \\(\mathbb Q^{\mathrm{ab}}\\), so it is the Frobenius \\(\mathrm{Frob}_p\\). Accordingly, we embed \\(K\hookrightarrow\mathbb Q_p^{\mathrm{unr}}\\), and we see that \\(\mathrm{Frob}_p\\) extends (uniquely) to the usual Frobenius in \\(\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb Q_p^{\mathrm{unr}}/\mathbb Q_p)\\), which is a topological generator. We conclude that \\(\mathrm{Frob}_p\\) acts trivially on \\(K\\) if and only if \\(K\subseteq\mathbb Q_p\\).

> **Remark 5.**
If we write \\(K=\mathbb Q(\sqrt d)\\), then the preceding example shows that
\\[\chi_d(p)\stackrel?=\left(\frac dp\right)\\]
for any odd prime \\(p\\) unramified in \\(K\\). Indeed, \\(K\subseteq\mathbb Q_p\\) if and only if \\(\sqrt d\in\mathbb Q_p\\). Because \\(p\\) does not divide \\(d\\), this is equivalent to having \\(\sqrt d\in\mathbb Z_p\\). By Hensel's lemma (noting that \\(p\\) is odd for now), this is equivalent to \\(\sqrt d\in\mathbb F_p\\), which is equivalent to \\(\left(\frac dp\right)=+1\\).

> **Remark 6.**
Here is another way to derive the result of Remark 5: \\(\mathrm{Frob}_p\\) fixes \\(\sqrt d\\) if and only if \\(p\\) splits completely in \\(K=\mathbb Q(\sqrt d)\\). An understanding of prime-splitting in quadratic fields shows that splitting completely is equivalent to \\(\sqrt d\in\mathbb F_p\\), which means \\(\left(\frac dp\right)=1\\).

> **Remark 7.**
The same argument as in Remark 5 also works for \\(p=2\\) when it is unramified, meaning \\(d\equiv1\pmod4\\). We claim that
\\[\chi_d(2)=\begin{cases}+1 & \text{if }d\equiv1\pmod 8,\\\\-1 & \text{if }d\equiv5\pmod 8.\end{cases}.\\]
To see this, note \\(\chi_d(2)=+1\\) if and only if \\(\mathbb Q(\sqrt d)\\) embeds into \\(\mathbb Q_2\\). This is equivalent to having \\(\frac{1+\sqrt d}2\in\mathbb Q_2\\), which means that \\(x^2-x+\frac{1-d}4\\) has a root. This now descends by Hensel's lemma to having \\(x^2-x+\frac{1-d}4\\) admit a root over \\(\mathbb F_2\\), which is equivalent to \\(\frac{1-d}4\equiv0\pmod2\\), or \\(d\equiv1\pmod8\\).

We now attempt to compute the conductor of \\(\chi_K\\). By the nature of the canonical isomorphism \\(\widehat{\mathbb Z}^\times\cong\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb Q^{\mathrm{ab}}/\mathbb Q)\\), this means that we need to find the smallest \\(N\\) for which \\(K\subseteq\mathbb Q(\zeta_N)\\). This amounts to a classification of the quadratic subfields of cyclotomic fields, for which we pick up the following result.

> **Proposition 8.**
Fix a positive integer \\(N\\). Let \\(S\\) denote the set consisting of \\(p^*\\) for each odd prime divisor \\(p\\) of \\(N\\), along with \\(-1\\) if \\(4\mid N\\) and \\(2\\) if \\(8\mid N\\). For a squarefree integer \\(d\\), we have \\(\sqrt d\in\mathbb Q(\zeta_N)\\) if and only if \\(d\\) is a product of elements in \\(S\\).

*Proof.*
Omitted. See [this blog post](/posts/2025/11/quadratic-subfields-cyclotomic/). \\(\blacksquare\\)

> **Corollary 9.**
Let \\(d\\) be a squarefree integer, and set \\(K=\mathbb Q(\sqrt d)\\). Then the conductor of \\(\chi_K\\) is the absolute value of the discriminant of \\(K\\). In other words, the conductor is
\\[\begin{cases}\left|d\right| & \text{if }d\equiv1\pmod4, \\\\ 4\left|d\right| & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\\]

*Proof.*
Let \\(N\\) be the conductor, which by definition means that \\(\mathbb Q(\zeta_N)\\) is the smallest cyclotomic field containing \\(K\\). By Proposition 8, we see that \\(\mathbb Q(\zeta_N)\\) containing \\(\sqrt d\\) means that each prime dividing \\(d\\) also divides \\(N\\), so we at least have \\(d\mid N\\). On the other hand, we see that \\(\mathbb Q(\zeta_{4d})\\) has square roots of all the prime factors of \\(d\\) (even \\(2\\)) as well as \\(\sqrt{-1}\\), so certainly \\(N\le4d\\).

We now have the following cases.
- If \\(d\\) is even, then Proposition 8 tells us that we must also have \\(8\mid N\\). It follows that \\(N\ge4d\\), so equality follows.
- If \\(d\equiv1\pmod4\\), then we see
    \\[d=\prod_{p\mid d}p^*.\\]
    Indeed, this certainly holds up to sign by unique prime factorization, and we have the correct sign by checking\\(\pmod4\\). It follows that \\(N\le d\\), so equality follows.
- If \\(d\equiv3\pmod4\\), then the previous point shows that \\(\sqrt{-d}\in\mathbb Q(\zeta_d)\\). Thus, because \\(\sqrt{-1}\notin\mathbb Q(\zeta_d)\\), we are forced to have \\(4\mid N\\) and so \\(N\ge4d\\), so equality follows.

The above cases complete the proof. \\(\blacksquare\\)

> **Remark 10.**
It is perhaps worth saying something about why it would be difficult to compute the conductor \\(N\\) of \\(\chi_K\\). In brief, a straightforward calculation with the definition of the Frobenius (in Example 4 and Remarks 5 and 6) was able to show that
\\[\chi_K(p)=\left(\frac dp\right)\\]
for any odd prime \\(p\\). (Another way to say this is that this calculation happens entirely on the "Galois side.") However, establishing a conductor means that \\(\chi_K\\) should factor through \\((\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z)^\times\\), meaning the Jacobi symbol \\(\left(\frac dp\right)\\) should only depend on \\(p\pmod N\\). Thus, the existence of a conductor has a similar level of strength as quadratic reciprocity. Indeed, in [this blog post](/posts/2025/11/quadratic-subfields-cyclotomic/), we saw that putting \\(K\\) inside the correct cyclotomic field allows one to quickly prove quadratic reciprocity.
